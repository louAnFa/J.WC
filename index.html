          <h2>Additional Information</h2>
          <p>When it comes to pricing, I plan to offer affordable rates to make this service accessible. Most professionals charge a lot, and their schedules are often busy. I can offer the same great service at a lower price, and I’m flexible with when I can work. You won’t have to wait days or weeks to get your windows cleaned — I can fit you into my schedule right away!</p>
          <p>For window cleaning, the price will depend on the size of the job, negotiation, depending on the number of windows, etc,. I’m open to negotiating the price to make sure you’re happy with the service. I’m not just here to make money — I want to learn, provide a great job, and make sure you’re satisfied with the results.</p>
          <p>Some might wonder why you’d trust a 13-year-old to clean windows. The truth is, I’m dedicated, responsible, and ready to work hard to prove that age doesn’t matter when it comes to quality. I’m taking this seriously, and I promise to do a better job than most professionals because I will always go the extra mile and focus on doing a great job for you.</p>
          <p>When you hire me, you’re not just getting someone to clean your windows — you’re getting someone who cares about doing it right, who is excited to learn, and who is committed to being responsible and respectful in every job. I may not have years of experience, but I’m ready to prove myself and show you that a 13-year-old can do the job just as well as anyone else.</p>
